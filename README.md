# VRC Guide

The idea behind this document is to help the reader get started and excel in VEX Robotics. I will try to document everything I have learned over a few years doing VEX Robotics. Most of the advice presented here is from mistakes I have made over the years. There is one caveat, I may not always be correct and so I encourage you to treat this document as a starting point. Aside from that, there are a countless number of people on the Unofficial Vex Teams of the World Discord that have several more years of experience than I do and I encourage you to get on and ask questions especially in the #hardware and #software channels. With that out of the way, I sincerely hope this document will continue to help long past Iâ€™ve graduated.

With this guide, I hope to cover the following topics:

- Team Organization
- Robot Design Principles
- Robot Building Tips
- Programming
- Notebook
- Judges Interview
