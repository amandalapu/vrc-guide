# 2 - Team Organization + Project Management

# 2.1 - Team Organization

There isn’t really any set end all be all with team organization and this area was one my consistent struggles throughout the years. However, if I had to give a preference, I would prefer a small dedicated team over a large undedicated one.

Team sizes tend to be large especially as a public school robotics program, and with that comes several challenges.

These challenges include:

- Finding something for everyone to be doing at every meeting
- Keeping everyone on task and focused
- In notebook and judge presentations, having something for each person to say they worked on
- From a captain POV, switching back and forth to help different members
    - This gets really exhausting, you incur the cognitive switching penalty and you end up not really doing much yourself
- Having enough tools and space to work

There are several solutions to this problem that I found have helped:

- Having a spreadsheet of tasks that team members can check on
    - Make tasks explicit especially for newer members
    - Key thing here is to assign tasks to members beforehand so there is less friction during a meeting in figuring out what to do
- Splitting the team into subteams
    - I found that having these subteams independently designing solutions is a great way to replicate the small team feel
- Assign team members to work on other simultaneous projects such as notebook or interview or organization
    - This is not ideal for those who wanted to work on the robot but rotating who gets time on robot and who does not is a good compromise

# 2.2 - Team Housekeeping

There are certain tasks that I would strongly recommend doing fairly consistently and fairly often.

### **2.2.1 - Cleaning Up Toolboxes**

These include organizing the toolboxes on a regular basis as parts quickly get disorganized and before long, it becomes really detrimental to overall efficiency.

The best tip I can give for this is to not get disorganized in the first place though oftentimes that is hard to achieve. Aside from that, periodically cleaning up or assigning someone to do it is the best way to go.

### **2.2.2 - Process Log Forms**

At the end of every meeting or the day after the meeting, a process log form is sent out. The goal of the process log is to record what each member did at the meeting.

Having this on a form is particularly helpful for notebook when the notebook team has to catch up on previous process logs. It is better to have some record of what each person did at a meeting than trying to remember what they did several days or even weeks later.

It is important to be prompt when sending out the form and that members are specific when filling it out. This only helps the notebook team be more specific when recording meetings.

This form can be very simple, in my time we had fields for member name, date and what they did that day.

# 2.3 - Time Management

Admittedly, I have not been the best with time management but hindsight is always 20/20. What makes a good robotics team after a certain point is the amount of time spent tuning and perfecting a design.

### **2.3.1 - Time Management Over the Year**

The year can be divided up into three major sections:

**Early Season (April - September)**

- This is the time where everyone is just figuring different ways to play the game
- There are not really many tournaments during this time
- I would suggest this time as perfect to go through as many ideas as possible as this is one of the only instances where you will have this much time
- **Objective: Test out various designs, get ready for first tournament**

**Mid Season (September - January)**

- This is when the bulk of the tournaments are hosted
- Around this time, the meta will arise
    - The meta-design tends to be the design that has been proven to work well and that most people either copied exactly or modified slightly
        - Examples: Double-Reverse Stackers with a small 4-Bar Mobile Goal mechanism during 'In The Zone'
- If your summer robot does not seem to be enough to qualify you for states, try and rebuild as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality, if your design does not work, do not stick to it longer than you have to
- **Objective: Qualify for regional championship as soon as possible, once qualified start building regionals robot**

**Late Season (January - April)**

- This is where the grind time begins assuming you have qualified for regionals at this point
- Regionals usually takes place at the end of February and so late January/early February is the latest you can get qualified
- This is where you try and get the best performing robot possible
    - Highest possible skills scores
    - Reliable, high-scoring autonomous program
    - Updated Notebook
    - Well-practiced presentation
    - **Driver Practice**
        - Driver Practice is often neglected, having tons of driver practice is what differentiates teams, do not spend too much time build and not enough time practicing

Although not really in the spirit of innovating, what tends to work really well is finding the meta design (the design that appears to be working the best).  Depending on the game, it could be early on or late season but the most important thing is to get started early.

### **2.3.2 - Time Management Before a Tournament**

This applies to most tournaments but especially for important tournaments such as Regional Championships and World Championships

Ideally finish >95% of building about two weeks before the tournament. I personally have never achieved this but if I could, this would be the ideal.

The last two weeks before a tournament is ideally spent on programming both autonomous programs and programming skills. You never know when you may get to run skills again and in certain cases, it can qualify you for states or worlds. (However, always strive to qualify for each tournament directly at each tournament rather than relying on skills scores)

Notebook and Team Presentation should be ready to go 2-3 days before the actual tournament itself.

Treating every tournament with the level of the state championship is the way to go.

**If there is only one thing you take away from this entire document: *let it be that you should never neglect driver practice.***

***A robot may be good but it will never perform well unless the driver has practiced.***

# 2.4 - Project Management

(by Hasif Shaikh)

For managing a team effectively, it is not just time that matters, it is the people you are managing as well. I’ve had 2 years of experience implementing an agile project management system, and was the lead project manager of SPARK and now UT Robomasters. Below are my main points of advice that I would give regarding project management. If done effectively, PM or project management can easily expedite the workflow of a team.

## 2.4.1 - What is Project Management and Why is it Important?

Project management is essentially a process of coordinating people to output a project/product in a certain time frame given resources. In a less formal definition, project management is about managing your resources to get the most out of them. The main thing to remember is that **no singular system works for all teams**. I’ll provide the essential elements of a project management system and how I would implement it, but adapt it to fit your team.

## 2.4.2 - Elements of Project Management

The first and probably most important part of project management is to realize that your two most important resources are **time** and **labor**. The easiest and most general rule of thumb is to ensure that if someone is able to work at such time, they have something to do. 

Hence the first step is to figure out how much time each team member can contribute. This can be usually done in small project management update meetings. In these meetings, you establish how much time team members are able to work for the time period. It doesn’t have to be an exact value, but it is so that the team has a ballpark estimate to see if the tasks can be done in a given time. Technically speaking this step is optional if your team in general has trust and experience amongst each other, but for beginner teams or those new to project management I would highly encourage not skipping this step.

The next step is to outline what needs to be done before your next hard deadline and choosing specific tasks to be done. By identifying these tasks, you can start figuring out each task’s dependencies and estimated time remaining from your experts. An example of dependency is that you need to build an intake before you tune it, or something like you need to mount your intake to your drive base before you conduct effective intake testing. The general rule of thumb when it comes to prioritizing tasks is to prioritize the removal of bottlenecks. The next biggest thing is to assign a reasonable amount of tasks. I feel that this is relatively self-explanatory but you definitely do not want to overload your team. When choosing what to do for a certain time period, think about if you have time to do what is left as well.

From there, it comes to a question of assigning tasks to members. Obviously, there are tasks that can be done by everyone, but having it be assigned helps team members know who is accountable. Always make sure when assigning the tasks that the person it is assigned to agrees that they can do it and it is possible. One personal tip regarding those who overestimate what they can do is to assign less than they say they can handle. For example, if they say that they can finish a task in 2 days but you know that they on average do a similar type of task in 4, assume it will take 4 days.

From there, you rinse and repeat.

## 2.4.3 - A Few Examples of PM Implementation

The best example for an overall season-wide project management implementation model is that of an organization I mentor, Lovejoy High School Robotics (1082) from Lucas, TX (my high school). Notice how in their template varsity timeline how in each project cycle there is sub tasks, and each sub task there is an assignment for people. The biggest thing to note is that programmers are working year round. This reduces the time crunch they have between the build being completed and competition.

This is a glimpse into how SPARK implemented their project management in Change Up. We chose an adaptation of the agile project management system. 

We began each project management cycle with a set of overall goals that we want to complete, and a tentative sub goal outline with milestone deadlines, and lastly, set a date for the next project management update with goals that we will reach for then.

On the next date, we reconvene, evaluate if we are on track, etc., and make goals for the next cycle, etc. If we encounter a setback in our goals, this is where we adjust the timeline like it says.

## 2.4.3 - Important things to Remember

I am going to split these tips to communication and other stuff. Communication is probably the most important part of having an effective project management

<aside>
☝🏾 The biggest key to project management is communication. Being able to communicate time, the current status, and dealing with failed deadlines is what separates a good project manager from a great project manager

</aside>

- I know I mentioned labor and time in a very cold, dehumanizing way in this guide but please be aware that your team members are human too. If there are team members who aren’t meeting their deadlines, don’t just immediately blame them. It is more beneficial to ask if they are overwhelmed or what’s happening and reach a resolution in a civil manner.
- Ensure team members are not just aware of what they need to do, but of what others are doing as well. This helps a lot when it comes to coordinating between sub teams and having greater understanding across the team if something goes wrong
- Be prepared to mediate arguments, especially deadlines.

### Tips for Project Managers

- Never assign more tasks than someone can handle
    - It is better to under assign and re-evaluate than to over assign tasks to people. Over assigning tasks is a very easy way to have members become burnt out
- The point of having members be working whenever they are willing to is to spread out the load of their tasks throughout the season. The biggest one that this applies to in my experience is programmers while builders are building. My best advice for that is to either have the programmer aid in the building process or to build a dedicated drive base or something for them to develop drive code such as PID, odometry, etc.
- If you find that you are not reaching your goals, that’s alright. It is also ok to not reach your goals and to compromise, whether that comes to skipping a competition or skipping development of a specific feature. Obviously, I would propose that this is one of your final options if you are not reaching your goals, but make sure you learn and adjust for the next time.
- Project management may be led by a singular individual, but it takes an entire team to buy into a system to be effective. If you are a PM leader, encourage participation from everyone into the process and ensure that everyone is on board with the system in place.
