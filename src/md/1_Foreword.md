# 1.1 - Foreword

Hi! My name is Akhil and I was involved with the Carnegie Robotics Team from 2016 - 2020 spending my first year on 285A and the last 3 as captain of 285X. From 2020-2021, I was involved with the VEXU team SPARK. In that time, I have qualified for the World Championships 4 times and won 19 awards including the Design Award at the VEXU Quality In-Person Event.

The idea behind this document is to help the reader get started and excel in VEX Robotics. I will try to document everything I have learned over a few years doing VEX Robotics. Most of the advice presented here is from mistakes I have made over the years. There is one caveat, I may not always be correct and so I encourage you to treat this document as a starting point. Aside from that, there are a countless number of people on the Unofficial Vex Teams of the World Discord that have several more years of experience than I do and I encourage you to get on and ask questions especially in the #hardware and #software channels. With that out of the way, I sincerely hope this document will continue to help long past I’ve graduated.

With this guide, I hope to cover the following topics:

- Team Organization
- Robot Design Principles
- Robot Building Tips
- Programming
- Notebook
- Judges Interview

In this guide, I will not be covering the overall structure of a VEX Tournament and qualification information since that information can be readily found on the internet.

### Addendum (May 30, 2022)

It is important to note that this guide was originally written in April of 2020 at the end of the 2019-2020 season, Tower Takeover. Since then, the world and the VEX landscape has drastically changed. The fortunate thing is that there are even better and more comprehensive resources for specifics found online such as the BLRS wiki which goes into a lot more detail on the specifics of various subsystems and programming concepts. Eventually, I would like to pass this guide onto the next generation who can continue to add more information, but to that extent - I personally believe a platform like the BLRS wiki is best suited for that. 

Since the original version I wrote in 2020, I have met many more insightful individuals who have contributed to the guide such as Hasif Shaikh (whose writing you can see in section 2.4) and Sai Senapathi (whose writing you can see in section 3.3.3 and 3.3.4)

The existence of such a resource often led me to debate creating a revamped version of the guide and to question what role I want this guide to serve. Ultimately, I have come to the conclusion that I want this guide’s focus to be more on the mentality and thought process that goes beyond the particulars of what parts are legal or certain game manual changes. Even though there is a lot of content overlap, maybe there is still value in hearing a different voice on the same topic.
