# 9.1 - Final Words

My intention with this guide is to try to help you out with your journey with VEX Robotics.

If I ever have a chance to show my gratitude to the people I have worked with along the way, I would like to take the opportunity to do it here. I'd like to thank all of the people I've met at Discobots and at SPARK.

First, I would like to thank my team over the years for being with me through both the ups and downs of robotics, without you all we could have not gotten very far. 

There are a lot of other topics I wish I could have covered in this guide however I found that several online resources have explained these topics in greater detail than I ever could. The main one of these resources is the VEX Knowledge Base which I wish I had when I started out.

My main hope with this guide is to pass this down for future generations, to be another helpful voice in the journey of becoming a competitive team and getting the most out of robotics.

Without a doubt, things will change from the time I have written this and so I hope this document has a chance to be updated throughout the years.

For me, robotics was a rewarding experience and where I found my second family. I hope you get to experience all that robotics has to offer during your time on the team. Even though I do not necessarily plan to go into engineering or robotics much in the future,  being able to leverage the design process and competing in VEX has taught me a lot of transferable skills such as documentation and having a competitive mindset that will serve me well in my future field of healthcare. 

I wish you the best of luck and I know youâ€™ll do great!
